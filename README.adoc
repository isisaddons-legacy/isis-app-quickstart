http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis]â„¢ software is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven apps in Java. You write your business logic in entities, domain services and repositories, and the framework dynamically generates a representation of that domain model as a webapp or a RESTful API.

This repository contains a example app that is just a copy of the application generated by Isis' own http://isis.apache.org/guides/ug.html#_ug_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[simpleapp archetype]. However, it also integrates with many of the https://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Addons], such as https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[security], https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[command profiling], https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-audit[auditing], https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-publishing[event publishing].  It also


== Security

* seed service `org.isisaddons.module.security.seed.SeedSecurityModuleService` for security (sets up `isis-module-security-admin/pass` user and roles)
* seed service `domainapp.app.seed.DomainAppRolesAndPermissionsSeedService` for app (sets up `domainapp-admin/pass` and roles)


== App Manifests

* `domainapp.app.DomainAppAppManifestWithFixtures`
* `domainapp.app.DomainAppAppManifest`
* `domainapp.app.DomainAppAppManifestBypassSecurity`
