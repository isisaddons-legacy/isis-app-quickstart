http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis]â„¢ software is a framework for rapidly developing domain-driven apps in Java. You write your business logic in entities, domain services and repositories, and the framework dynamically generates a representation of that domain model as a webapp or a RESTful API.

This repository contains a example app that is just a copy of the application generated by Isis' own http://isis.apache.org/guides/ug.html#_ug_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[simpleapp archetype].  However, it also integrates with many of the https://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Addon] modules and components (for cross-cutting concerns), and also integrates modules from
the http://catalog.incode.org[Incode Catalog] (for reusable business functionality).

The app in this repository is also a good starting point for demos; see this link:DEMO-SCRIPT.adoc[DEMO-SCRIPT] page.


== Security

* seed service `org.isisaddons.module.security.seed.SeedSecurityModuleService` for security
** sets up `isis-module-security-admin/pass` user and roles
* seed service `domainapp.app.seed.DomainAppRolesAndPermissionsSeedService` for app
** sets up `domainapp-admin/pass` and roles)


== App Manifests

* `domainapp.app.DomainAppAppManifest`
* `domainapp.app.DomainAppAppManifestWithFixtures`
* `domainapp.app.DomainAppAppManifestWithFixturesBypassSecurity`
